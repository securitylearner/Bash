                                To ping all the IP addresses in your network 

Check the IP address using the command - ifconfig
Ping any of the devices in the same network (ex ping 192.168.57.2)
We can limit the packets count using the flag -c in the ping 
trying to send only 1 packet using  -c 1 

ping -c1 192.168.57.2

Bash script to ping all the IP Addresses at once


#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" == "" ]
then
echo "You forgot an IP address!"
echo "Syntax: ./pingsweep.sh 192.168.1"
else
for ip in `seq 1 254`; do
ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done
fi



To Ping and save the result in a text file (replace the 20th line with the below command)

ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" >> ipaddresses.txt &
